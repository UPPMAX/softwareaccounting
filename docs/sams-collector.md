= SAMS collector

The collector is run on the compute-node and collects information about the running jobs.

= Parts

The collector contains of three parts. The pidfinder, the sampler and the outputs.

== pidfinder

This plugin finds process ids (PID) of a job.

== sampler

This plugins gets the PIDs from pidfinder and collects metrics about the processes.

== output

This plugins output the result of the samplers info different kinds of ways.

= Command line arguments

== --jobid=

Jobid to collect information about. 

Note: In slurm this must be the ''JobIDRaw'' and not the jobid with job array extension (NNNNNN_A)

== --config=<file>

Path to configuration file.

Default: /etc/sams/sams-collector.yaml

== --node=

Name of the current node. 

Default: ''hostname'' of the machine.

== --logfile=<filename>

If set a logfile will be created at <filename>.

The logfile have substitions ''%(jobid)s'' and ''%(node)s'' to create more unique names.

Logfile can also be set via the configuration file. If provided on command line the command line option will be used.

== --loglevel=

Sets the loglevel for the logfile.

Loglevel can also be set via the configuration file. If provided on command line the command line option will be used.

Available options: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG 

Default: ERROR

== --daemon

Send collector into background.

== --pidfile=<path>

Create pid file at <path>.

= Configuration

Core options of SAMS collector.

== pid_finder_update_interval

The number of seconds to wait before trying to find new pids.

== pid_finder

Name of the plugin that finds PIDs.

== samplers

A list of plugins that sample metrics about the PIDs.

== outputs

A list of plugins that stores the metrics from the samplers.

== logfile

If set a logfile will be created.

The logfile have substitions ''%(jobid)s'' and ''%(node)s'' to create more unique names.

Logfile can also be set via the command line. If provided on command line the command line option will be used.

== loglevel

Sets the loglevel for the logfile.

Loglevel can also be set via the command line. If provided on command line the command line option will be used.

Available options: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG 

Default: ERROR
